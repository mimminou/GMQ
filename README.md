# GMQ
The Gopher Message Queue

# What is this :
A straightforward, dead simple message broker.

The only configuration you need to worry about is specifiying a port when running it.

It is not designed to be a full fledged message broker, it is a tool that may help people be introducted to message queue services on a surface level, or for testing in dev environments.
